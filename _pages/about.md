Hi! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://engineering.stanford.edu/), advised by Prof. [Doug L. James](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~djames/). My research has been generously supported by a [Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf/details), a [Roblox Graduate Fellowship](https://www.gem.com/lp/roblox/ec-roblox-fellows) and an [NVIDIA Graduate Fellowship](https://research.nvidia.com/graduate-fellowships/2025).


I have a broad interest in computer graphics, including physical simulation, geometry processing and computational design. Currently, my research primarily focuses on developing intelligent algorithms, models and tools for enhancing user creativity and productivity in design, animation and simulation.


Before, I completed my undergraduate studies in computer science and math at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), advised by Prof. [Alec Jacobson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/). During my time there, I was fortunate to do research with Profs. [Marc Alexa](https://www.cg.tu-berlin.de/team/prof-dr-marc-alexa/), [David Levin](http://142.93.146.228/researchdb/), [Fanny Chevalier](http://fannychevalier.net/) and [Ken Jackson](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~krj/) on topics spanning computer graphics, human-computer interaction, and numerical analysis.  I also had wonderful internships at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), where I began collaborating closely with my mentor Dr. [Danny Kaufman](http://dannykaufman.io/).
